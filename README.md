The Bootstrap Mobile-First challenge is about modifying the code for the Dawg
Pizza website to make it friendly to smaller screens. The goal is to learn how
to design websites for a wide variety of screens, instead of just a typical 
laptop or desktop display. Incorporating bootstrap media queries and col shift
tools, the Pizza Dawg website now looks good on mobile.
